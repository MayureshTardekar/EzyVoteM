# EzyVoteM - Voting DApp

This project is a decentralized voting application that allows users to vote in real-time for various candidates in an election event.

## Features

- **Real-Time Voting**: Users can vote for candidates, and the vote count is updated in real-time.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Votes are updated live using WebSocket to ensure seamless real-time interaction.
- **Vote Tracking**: The app keeps track of total votes and highlights the leading candidate.

## Project Setup

To get started with this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAYURESH0512/EzyVoteM.git
cd EzyVoteM
2. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using npm or yarn:

npm install
# or
yarn install
3. Start the Application

Run the project locally:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

4. Running Tests (Optional)

To run the test suite:

npm test
# or
yarn test

5. Use Hardhat for Smart Contract Development (If applicable)

If you have any Hardhat-related smart contract development:

    Run tests:

npx hardhat test

Run a local Hardhat node:

npx hardhat node

Deploy contracts:

    npx hardhat deploy --network localhost

Web3 Integration

Ensure you are connected to a testnet or local blockchain for interacting with the smart contract.

    Use MetaMask to interact with the decentralized application (DApp).

    Confirm the network (Energy Web Volta Testnet, Ethereum Testnet, etc.) is set properly in MetaMask.

### **Key Changes in the Custom README**:
1. **Removed the default Hardhat template**: The sample Hardhat contract and test instructions were removed.
2. **Added project-specific details**: Information on what your project does (real-time voting with WebSocket) and basic setup instructions.
3. **Simplified Hardhat references**: You still have references to **Hardhat testing** and **deploying** if needed, but they are now optional steps for your development.

### **How to Apply This**:
1. Copy the provided template into your `README.md`.
2. Replace any project-specific details (like testing, smart contract usage, etc.) based on your current work.

This way, you will have a temporary, more relevant README without the default Hardhat information! Let me know if you need further adjustments!
